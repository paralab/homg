\subsection*{Reply to Referee 2:}

Thanks for the careful reading and the helpful comments.
Please find below point-by-point replies to your comments and
questions. To give you an overview of all the changes in the paper, we
also provide a diff-document that highlights the changes between the
initial submission and this resubmission.

\subsubsection*{Detailed replies (your comments in blue)}

\referee{ Comments to the Author\\[.2ex] The paper presents a very
  nice computational survey of the most natural (and popular)
  approaches for the application of geometric Multigrid to second
  order elliptic problems discretized with high-order finite
  elements. This is timely and interesting study, given the increasing
  importance of high-order methods on modern computing
  architectures. The authors are to be commended for the interesting
  choice of problems (high-order meshes, polynomial orders up to 16,
  etc.) as well as for the freely available companion Matlab
  software. I liked the presentation and I found the results
  interesting.}
\noindent
Thanks.

\referee{ I therefore recommend the manuscript for publication with
  the following minor remarks:}

\referee{ 1) Section 2 refers to Figure 1 (first paragraph on page 4),
  but discusses only the first two approaches depicted there. This can
  be confusing.}
We have changed the figure reference to focus on the first two approaches. 

\referee{ 2) Why are the h-Multigrid spaces nested for the domains in
  Figure 4?}

\referee{ 3) It looks like SSOR is amplifying some error components
  when used as a smoother in Figure 3 (e.g. for p=4). Isn't Ak SPD in
  this case?}

\referee{ 4) Have you tried using the l1-Jacobi smoother from [2]?
  This smoother is always convergent, so it may approve the results of
  e.g. Table II.}
We will add these.

\referee{ 5) What is the coarse grid in Section 3.2.2, the one
  obtained by h-coarsening (and interpolation)?}
Yes, we have clarified this in the text as well.

\referee{ 6) A few typos: "loose" on page 1, "corresponds" on page 4,
  extra "rate" on page 7.}
\noindent
These have been corrected.
