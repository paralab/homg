\section{Introduction}

We are interested on asymptotically
optimal---$\mathcal{O}(N)$---complexity solvers for approximating the
solution of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), where $N$
is the number of unknowns.  Multigrid is such a solver. In practice
however, multigrid performs best for low-order uniform discretizations
with smooth coefficients. 

Our goal is to develop a parallel geometric multigrid for solving
systems arising from higher-order discretizations of
variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential equations on
arbitrary geometries using highly adapted meshes.
High-order discretizations offer several advantages.  According to
standard isoparametric polynomial approximation theory,
% the approximation error in the $L_2$-norm is bounded by,
% \[
% \|u-u_h\|_{L_2} \le Ch^{p+1}\|u\|_{H^{p+1}(\Omega)},
% \]   
% where $\|\cdot\|_{H^p}$ is the standard $H^p$ Sobolev norm, $\|\cdot\|_{L_2}$ is the $L_2$-norm, $u$ is the exact solution of the PDE, and $u_h$ is the solution of the $h$-discrete problem. Therefore, 
by using a finite element basis of at least degree $p$, we can achieve
very fast $\mathcal{O}(N^{-(p+1)})$ convergence for sufficiently
smooth problems while improving the locality and thus the CPU
efficiency of the calculations.

 Our method is designed for meshes that are built from an unstructured
hexahedral macro mesh, in which each macro element is adaptively
refined as an octree. This forest-of-octrees approach enables us to
generate meshes for complex geometries with arbitrary levels of local
refinement. We use geometric multigrid (GMG) for each of the octrees
and algebraic multigrid (AMG) as the coarse grid solver. We designed
our GMG sweeps to entirely avoid collectives, thus minimizing
communication cost. Recently \cite{sundar12}, we presented weak and strong scaling
results for the 3D variable-coefficient Poisson problem using linear
discretization that demonstrate high parallel scalability. Here we
explore various approaches for extending our geometric multigrid
solver to support higher-order discretizations.

For higher-order finite-element discretizations, the following approaches are commonly used, 
\begin{description}

	\item[Schwarz-based methods] This is the most common approach for
	solving systems arising from higher-order discretizations, which
	consists of local block solves and a coarse-grid solve. The main
	challenge with these approaches is they require solving dense local
	blocks with direct methods. Additionally, the coarse-grid solve can
	become fairly expensive and is not straightforward to achieve good
	parallel scalability. 

 \item[$p$-multigrid] These methods are a direct extension of
	multigrid concepts to higher-order discretization. The usual
	approach has been to use coarse grids based on lower-order
	polynomials. Starting from a fine grid with order-$p$ polynomial
	basis, the coarser grids correspond to polynomials of order $p/2,
	p/4,\ldots,1$, followed by geometric coarsening of the $p=1$
	grid. The main shortcoming of this approach has been the dependence
	of the convergence factor on the order of the polynomial
	basis. \textsc{Revisit. any other disadvantages}?

\item[precondition using lower-order operator] This
	approach preconditions the higher-order operator using a lower-order
	operator obtained by overlaying the higher-order nodes with a
	lower-order (typically linear) finite element mesh. Multigrid is
	used to solve the lower-order operator. Although this approach is
	nearly independent of $p$, and is relatively straightforward to
	parallelize, it is not work optimal and the convergence factors are
	lower than multigrid applied directly to the higher-order
	operator.  

\item[direct] Directly apply multigrid to iteratively
	solve the linear systems that result from the higher-order
	discretizations. This approach is more difficult to implement and
	the cost per iteration increases. However, our preliminary results
	suggest that such an approach is the most general.

In summary, the overall theme of existing work appears to use
low-order approximations as preconditioners.  The advantages of doing
this are mainly in the simplicity of the approach and the availability
of parallel multigrid solvers capable of solving such lower-order
operators. The sparsity of the lower-order operators also permits the
use of AMG for solving the lower-order operators, possibly obtained
via discretizations on unstructured meshes.  Although there are
examples of using Algebraic Multigrid directly on operators resulting
from higher-order discretizations, limited work has been done on using
geometric multigrid with higher-order discretizations. To the best of
our knowledge, no prior work on using geometric multigrid for solving
systems arising from higher-order discretizations on arbitrary
geometries using highly adapted meshes.  In this work, we develop
geometric multigrid methods to support higher-order discretizations
($1\le p\le 8$) and compare compare against preconditioning using the
co-located linear operator. We evaluate using variable-coefficient
Poisson problems on $2D$ and $3D$ domains. We demonstrate that by
using appropriate inter-grid transfer operators and smoothers,
mesh-independent convergence is possible ($1\le p\le8$) for the {\em
direct} approach. For the direct approach, best results are obtained
using the symmetric successive over-relaxation (SSOR) smoother. We
conclude with thoughts on the parallelization of the proposed
approach.
