\section{Introduction}

%We are interested on asymptotically
%optimal---$\mathcal{O}(N)$---complexity solvers for approximating the
%solution of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), where $N$
%is the number of unknowns.  Multigrid is such a solver. In practice
%however, multigrid performs best for low-order uniform discretizations
%with smooth coefficients. 

We target parallel geometric multigrid methods for solving systems
arising from higher order (we target polynomial orders up to 8)
discretizations of elliptic partial differential equations. In
particular, our interest is on large-scale problems with complex
geometry and adaptively refined meshes, and the implementation of
these methods on parallel high performance computing platforms. Thus,
we favor (1) matrix-free methods, i.e., method that do not require
assembled finite element matrices, (2) methods that can be
parallelized on shared or distributed memory architectures, and (3)
cache-efficient methods with dominantly local memory access.

High order spatial discretizations can have significant advantages
over low order methods, especially when the solution is smooth and
high accuracy is desired. However, the sparsity of finite element (or
finite difference) operators decreases as the polynomial approximation
order increases, which makes the application of high order operators
to vectors computationally significantly more expensive. This is also
true if matrix-free methods are used, i.e., system matrices are never
assembled, but their application on vectors is implemented through
elemental loops.  Besides the loss of sparsity, another challenge in
high-order discretizations is due to that fact that the discretization
matrices loose useful structural properties, such as the M-matrix
property that allows to prove convergence of iterative solvers such as
the Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel method.

\gsnote{Needs a literature review.}

%High-order discretizations offer several advantages.  According to
%standard isoparametric polynomial approximation theory,
%% the approximation error in the $L_2$-norm is bounded by,
%% \[
%% \|u-u_h\|_{L_2} \le Ch^{p+1}\|u\|_{H^{p+1}(\Omega)},
%% \]   
%% where $\|\cdot\|_{H^p}$ is the standard $H^p$ Sobolev norm, $\|\cdot\|_{L_2}$ is the $L_2$-norm, $u$ is the exact solution of the PDE, and $u_h$ is the solution of the $h$-discrete problem. Therefore, 
%by using a finite element basis of at least degree $p$, we can achieve
%very fast $\mathcal{O}(N^{-(p+1)})$ convergence for sufficiently
%smooth problems while improving the locality and thus the CPU
%efficiency of the calculations.


Although there are examples of using Algebraic Multigrid directly on
operators resulting from higher-order discretizations, limited work
has been done on using geometric multigrid with higher-order
discretizations. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work on using
geometric multigrid for solving systems arising from higher-order
discretizations on arbitrary geometries using highly adapted meshes.



%In this work, we develop
%geometric multigrid methods to support higher-order discretizations
%($1\le p\le 8$) and compare  against preconditioning using the
%co-located linear operator.

% We evaluate using variable-coefficient
%Poisson problems on $2D$ and $3D$ domains. We demonstrate that by
%using appropriate inter-grid transfer operators and smoothers,
%mesh-independent convergence is possible ($1\le p\le8$) for the {\em
%direct} approach. For the direct approach, best results are obtained
%using the symmetric successive over-relaxation (SSOR) smoother. We
%conclude with thoughts on the parallelization of the proposed
%approach.\\[2ex]

\section{Meshing, High-order FEM}

 Our method is designed for meshes that are built from an unstructured
hexahedral macro mesh, in which each macro element is adaptively
refined as an octree. This forest-of-octrees approach enables us to
generate meshes for complex geometries with arbitrary levels of local
refinement. We use geometric multigrid (GMG) for each of the octrees
and algebraic multigrid (AMG) as the coarse grid solver. We designed
our GMG sweeps to entirely avoid collectives, thus minimizing
communication cost. Recently \cite{SundarBirosBursteddeEtAl12}, we
presented weak and strong scaling results for the 3D
variable-coefficient Poisson problem using linear discretization that
demonstrate high parallel scalability. Here we explore various
approaches for extending our geometric multigrid solver to support
higher-order discretizations.

For three-dimensional hexahedral mesh finite element discretizations
with polynomial degree $p$, element matrices are of size
$n=(p+1)^3$. The naive assembly and application of these elemental
matrices requires $\mathcal O(p^9)$ operatrions, but exploiting the
tensor structure of the basis functions allows to reduce this to
$\mathcal O(p^7)$ operations.


\section{Approaches for High-order Multigrid}

% talk about the 4 main approaches and prior work.

In this section, we summarize different approaches for geometric
multigrid-based solvers and preconditioners for higher-order
finite-element discretizations. These methods can also be
appropriately combined.

\subsection{High-order $h$-multigrid}
A direct generalization of geometric multigrid from first order to
higher order discretizations is to use high order restriction and
prolongation operators together with the linear systems that result
from the higher-order discretizations on each coarse level.  The main
difficulty in this approach is that it requires smoothers for high
order systems matrices, which usually have less favorable properties
compared to their low order counterparts; For instance, higher-order
discretizations of scalar elliptic operators are usually not
M-matrices, which is a useful property to prove the convergence of
smoothers such as Jacobi of Gauss-Seidel.

% This
%approach is more difficult to implement and the cost per iteration
%increases. However, our preliminary results suggest that such an
%approach is the most general.

\subsection{$p$-multigrid}
The $p$-multigrid approach initially does not coarsen the mesh
geometrically, but coarsens the system by reducing the polynomial
order. Starting from an order-$p$ polynomial basis, the coarser grids
correspond to polynomials of order $p/2, p/4,\ldots,1$, followed by
geometric coarsening of the $p=1$ grid (i.e., the usual low order
geometric multigrid). Coarsening the polynomial order is rather simple
and element-local. The latter is particularly useful for
discretizations with nonconforming meshes. \gsnote{Is that actually
  true?}. Challenges for $p$-multigrid are devising appropriate
smoothers and the dependence of the convergence factor on the order of
the polynomial basis. \gsnote{We need a citation here.}


\subsection{Preconditioning by lower-order operator}
This approach preconditions the higher-order operator using a
lower-order operator obtained by overlaying the higher-order nodes
with a lower-order (typically linear) finite element mesh using the
same same nodes.  Multigrid is used to solve the lower-order operator,
which has more favorable sparsity properties and thus allows for
faster multigrid cycles compared to multigrid for the high order
discretized systems.  Although this approach is nearly independent of
$p$, and is relatively straightforward to parallelize, it is not work
optimal and the convergence factors are lower than multigrid applied
directly to the higher-order operator. \gsnote{Revisit statement.}
For nonconforming meshes, constructing the low order operator can be
technical at edges and faces of different size; while the basis
functions for the high order operators can be made continuous through
the use of proper algebraic constraints at nonconforming faces, the
corresponding low order discretization has discontinuities at
nonconforming faces.  The construction of a low-order preconditioner
based on the nodes of the high order discretization is a popular
approach \cite{Brown10,Kim07,DevilleMund?}.

The advantages of doing
this are mainly in the simplicity of the approach and the availability
of parallel multigrid solvers capable of solving such lower-order
operators. The sparsity of the lower-order operators also permits the
use of AMG for solving the lower-order operators, possibly obtained
via discretizations on unstructured meshes.


\subsection{Schwarz-based methods}
Another common approach for solving systems arising from higher-order
discretizations is based on local block solves.  The main challenge
with these approaches is that they require solving dense local blocks
either using direct methods or approximations that allow for fast
iterative solution \cite{LottesFischer05,FischerLottes05}.
Additionally, the coarse-grid solve can become fairly expensive and is
not straightforward to achieve good parallel scalability.
